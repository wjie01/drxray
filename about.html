            <p>In technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their action. 
                Now, AI is transforming the practice of medicine. 
                Hence, the automatic detection of chest disease based on chest radiography has become one of the hot topics in medical imaging research. 
                This is because it is helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. 
                Here, Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis (AI) is a diagnostic system of modern medicine. 
                The system will help you to analyse data for making decisions to diagnose or identify pathological conditions. 
                Thus, it can predict the probabilities of different pathological conditions in a short time. 
                Before creating the model of the system, the system uses data pre-processing method to check and prevent data leakage between the train, validation, and test datasets. 
                At the same time, it also implements a weighted loss function to address class imbalance. 
                For making disease predictions on chest X-Ray images, it will be used a pre-trained neural network. 
                For instance, you will be required to upload and submit a chest X-Ray image to the system. 
                The system will analyse your chest X-Ray image with using a trained model. 
                Afterwards, it will use a Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping’s (Grad-CAM) technique to produce a heatmap highlighting the important regions in the chest X-Ray image. 
                Finally, your chest X-Ray image with a heatmap highlighting the right regions and the probabilities of different pathological conditions will be shown out on the screen. 
                From this project, I hope it will bring more benefits to the healthcare industry and medical school. </p>
